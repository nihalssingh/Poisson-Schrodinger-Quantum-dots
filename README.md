# Poisson-Schrodinger-Quantum-dots
(Work in progress) Self-consistent Poisson-Schrödinger solvers to model quantum wells and dots in semiconductor devices

Use the Poisson solver to compute the electrostatic potential (V_T) due to the doping and quantum dot. 
Use the resulting potential profile as the input potential (V) in the Schrödinger solver to compute the quantum states.
